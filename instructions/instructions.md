# Trade-In Estimate Widget

## Objective
To build a trade-in estimate widget that allows users to input vehicle details and receive a trade-in value estimate based on Canadian Black Book data. The widget will provide a step-by-step guided experience, gathering all necessary information to calculate an accurate estimate and offering users the next steps to assess credit eligibility.

## Technical Requirements

- **Database Integration**: Access to vehicle database (e.g., Open Vehicle Database) to fetch make, model, and trim data.
- **API Integration**: Integrate with Canadian Black Book for real-time trade-in estimate values.
- **Multilingual Support**: Ability to toggle between English and French, translating all text accordingly.
- **Translation Files**: A folder containing different translation files for all steps and text to ensure easy management of multilingual support.
- **Frontend Framework**: Implement using Next.js with Tailwind CSS.
- **Form Validation**: Real-time validation on all steps (e.g., mileage must be a number, email format check).
- **Responsive Design**: Ensure the widget follows a mobile-first approach and is fully responsive for mobile, tablet, and desktop views.
- **Error Handling**: Gracefully handle errors in data fetching or submission with user-friendly error messages.
- **Icons**: Use Lucide icons for a consistent and modern visual experience.
- **UI Components**: Use Shadcn for building UI components.
